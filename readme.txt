Allows for more existing custom field names to be listed in the dropdown selection field when writing a post.


== Description ==

Allows for more existing custom field names to be listed in the dropdown selection field when writing a post.

By default, WordPress only allows 30 custom field names/keys to be listed in the dropdown selection 'Name' field when writing a post or page.  If you, or the plugins you use, make use of a lot of custom field key names, you may surpass the default limit resulting in some custom field keys not being listed.  This may force post authors to manually type in custom field key names if they aren't listed, which increases the chances for naming errors (typos, or not using the precise key name that is needed).  This may also cause some authors concern wondering where previously used custom field keys have gone since they aren't listed.

This plugin increases the limit to 200 custom field key names.  Due to the simplistic nature of the plugin and the overhead of doing so for a single setting, there is no settings page to customize this value.  Assuming you want to change the value of the limit to 100, you can do so in either of two ways:

1. By editing your wp-config.php file and at the end adding a line such as:
    `define('CUSTOM_FIELD_NAMES_LIMIT', 100);`
_-or-_
1. Somewhere, most likely in your active theme's functions.php file, hook the 'c2c_list_more_custom_field_names' filter and return the number you'd like:
    `add_filter('c2c_list_more_custom_field_names', create_function('$limit', 'return 100;'));`

== Installation ==

1. Unzip `list-more-custom-field-names.zip` inside the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory for your site (or install via the built-in WordPress plugin installer)
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' admin menu in WordPress
1. (Optional) In wp-config.php, customize the number of custom fields you want shown. The default of 200 can be changed by adding a line like:
    `define('CUSTOM_FIELD_NAMES_LIMIT', 100);`

There are two ways you can customize this value (in both examples, change 100 to the number you'd like to use):

1. In your wp-config.php file (in the root directory of your blog), add the following line of code (making sure it is within the opening `<?php` and closing `?>` PHP tags):

    `define('CUSTOM_FIELD_NAMES_LIMIT', 100);`

2. (recommented) Somewhere, most likely in your active theme's functions.php file, hook the 'c2c_list_more_custom_field_names' filter and return the number you'd like:

    `add_filter('c2c_list_more_custom_field_names', create_function('$limit', 'return 100;'));`
